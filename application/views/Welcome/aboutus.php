            <h3>Co-Founder </h3>
            <p>My name is Yves, Bagaza, I am African born and an American entrepreneur. I am currently attending school at Onondaga Community College and I’m majoring in business administration in my second year of college now. I started LavniCapital, Inc (public Corporation) because I believe they are many people out there who are willing to help but it is too hard to find the organizations that are making change in the community. I decided to build www.lavniworld.com because we believe that we should have a platform for community organizations which will make it easy for people to find them and pledge.</p>

            <h3>CO-Founder </h3>
            <p>My name is Casey Millet. I am in my second year of college studying physical therapy. I am very passionate about helping others and helping them conquer something new! I taught swimming lessons for 4 years, and during that time I loved to see the smile on my students faces after they have accomplished something, they were afraid of. My goal for lavniworld is for those in needs to be able to seek those who have the materials to help them get to where they need to be. Lavniworld’s goal is to help make a difference in others' lives.</p>
